-> + = completed and tested design

-> @ = shared work in progress design concept

-> ~ = local work in progress design concept (.gitignore file ignores these)

-> - = failed design concept (.gitignore file ignores these)

Types:
-Consider including a scale/size, e.g. medium, heavy, short

-Consider including a role, e.g. SSTO, SAR, Rover, etc. (combine with commas as needed)
